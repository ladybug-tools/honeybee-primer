Create Honeybee Shade 



#### Inputs
* ##### geo [Required]
Rhino Brep or Mesh geometry. 
* ##### name 
Text to set the name for the Shade and to be incorporated into unique Shade identifier. If the name is not provided, a random name will be assigned. 
* ##### attached 
Boolean to note whether the Shade is attached to other geometry. This is automatically set to True if the Shade is assigned to a parent Room, Face, Aperture or Door but will otherwise defalt to False. If the Shade is not easily assignable to a parent object but is attached to the building (eg. a parapet or large roof overhang), then this should be set to True. (Default: False). 
* ##### ep_constr 
Optional text for the Shade's energy construction to be looked up in the construction library. This can also be a custom construction object. If no energy construction is input here, a default will be assigned. 
* ##### ep_trans_sch 
Optional text for the Shade's energy transmittance schedule to be looked up in the schedule library. This can also be a custom schedule object. If no energy schedule is input here, the default will be always opaque. 
* ##### rad_mod 
Optional text for the Shade's radiance modifier to be looked up in the modifier library. This can also be a custom modifier object. If no radiance modifier is input here, a default will be assigned. 

#### Outputs
* ##### report
Reports, errors, warnings, etc. 
* ##### shades
Honeybee shades. These can be used directly in radiance and energy simulations.
