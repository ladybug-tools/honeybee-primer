Separate and group Honeybee Faces, Apertures, Doors and Shades by any attribute that the objects possess. 

This can be used to group faces by construction, modifier, etc.

#### Outputs
* ##### values
A list of values with one attribute value for each branch of the output hb_objs. 
* ##### hb_objs
A data tree of honeybee faces and sub-faces with each branc of the tree representing a different attribute value.
