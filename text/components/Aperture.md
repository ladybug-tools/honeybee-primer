Create Honeybee Aperture 



#### Inputs
* ##### geo [Required]
Rhino Brep or Mesh geometry. 
* ##### name 
Text to set the name for the Aperture and to be incorporated into unique Aperture identifier. If the name is not provided, a random name will be assigned. 
* ##### operable 
Boolean to note whether the Aperture can be opened for ventilation. 
* ##### ep_constr 
Optional text for the Aperture's energy construction to be looked up in the construction library. This can also be a custom WindowConstruction object. If no energy construction is input here, a default will be assigned based on the properties of the parent face that the Aperture is assigned to (ie. whether the Face is a RoofCeiling, whether it has a Surface boundary condition, etc.) 
* ##### rad_mod 
Optional text for the Aperture's radiance modifier to be looked up in the modifier library. This can also be a custom modifier object. If no radiance modifier is input here, a default will be assigned based on the properties of the parent face that the Aperture is assigned to (ie. whether the Face is a RoofCeiling, whether it has a Surface boundary condition, etc.) 

#### Outputs
* ##### report
Reports, errors, warnings, etc. 
* ##### apertures
Honeybee apertures. These can be used directly in radiance simulations or can be added to a Honeybee face for energy simulation.
