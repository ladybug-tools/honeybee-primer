Create Honeybee Rooms from solids (closed Rhino polysurfaces). 

Note that each Room is mapped to a single zone in EnergyPlus/OpenStudio and should always be a closed volume to ensure correct volumetric calculations and avoid light leaks in Radiance simulations. 



#### Inputs
* ##### geo [Required]
A list of closed Rhino polysurfaces (aka.breps) to be converted into honeybee Rooms. This list can also include closed meshes that represent the rooms. 
* ##### name 
Text to set the base name for the Room, which will also be incorporated into unique Room identifier. If the name is not provided, a random name will be assigned. 
* ##### mod_set 
Text for the modifier set of the Rooms, which is used to assign all default radiance modifiers needed to create a radiance model. Text should refer to a ModifierSet within the library) such as that output from the "HB List Modifier Sets" component. This can also be a custom ModifierSet object. If nothing is input here, the Room will have a generic construction set that is not sensitive to the Room's climate or building energy code. 
* ##### constr_set 
Text for the construction set of the Rooms, which is used to assign all default energy constructions needed to create an energy model. Text should refer to a ConstructionSet within the library such as that output from the "HB List Construction Sets" component. This can also be a custom ConstructionSet object. If nothing is input here, the Rooms will have a generic construction set that is not sensitive to the Rooms's climate or building energy code. 
* ##### program 
Text for the program of the Rooms (to be looked up in the ProgramType library) such as that output from the "HB List Programs" component. This can also be a custom ProgramType object. If no program is input here, the Rooms will have a generic office program. Note that ProgramTypes effectively map to OpenStudio space types upon export to OpenStudio. 
* ##### conditioned 
Boolean to note whether the Rooms have heating and cooling systems. 
* ##### roof_angle 
Cutting angle for roof from Z axis in degrees. Default: 30. 

#### Outputs
* ##### report
Reports, errors, warnings, etc. 
* ##### rooms
Honeybee rooms. These can be used directly in energy and radiance simulations.
